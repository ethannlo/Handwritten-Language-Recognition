## Overview

Handwritten Language Recognition is designed to tackle the challenge of classifying handwritten characters and language representations. This project explores different deep learning architectures, including:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** For extracting spatial features from handwritten images.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** For modeling sequential dependencies in the data.
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:** To improve the model’s ability to focus on critical regions of the input.

The project is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits, and demonstrates robust performance with 96% accuracy on classification tasks.

## Features

- **End-to-End Training Pipeline:** From data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines CNNs for feature extraction with RNNs for sequence modeling.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Implements Scaled Dot-Product Attention to enhance model focus.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves up to 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.
- **Modular Codebase:** Easy to extend and experiment with alternative architectures and datasets.

## Architecture

The project employs a multi-component neural network that includes:

1. **Convolutional Layers:**  
   - Extract spatial features from the input images.
   - Use Batch Gradient Descent for optimization.

2. **Recurrent Layers:**  
   - Process flattened feature maps to capture sequential patterns.
   - Utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or GRU cells (customizable based on experimentation).

3. **Attention Mechanism:**  
   - Scaled Dot-Product Attention is applied to improve the network’s ability to focus on the most informative parts of the input.
   - This helps in better handling variations in handwriting styles.
